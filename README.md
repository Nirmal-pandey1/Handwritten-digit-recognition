# Handwritten-digit-recognition
This repository showcases a handwritten digit recognition model built using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and the Digits dataset from Scikit-learn. The goal is to classify handwritten digits (0-9) with high accuracy by leveraging KNNâ€™s simplicity and effectiveness in pattern recognition.
